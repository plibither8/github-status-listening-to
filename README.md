> Update my GitHub status to whatever song I'm listening

Updates my GitHub status to whatever song I'm listening right now, in the format "ðŸŽ§ Listening to [name] by [artist]".

Really just set this up to get my hands dirty with GraphQL. And why not?

**TODO:** Run script on a cloud server (probably DO).
